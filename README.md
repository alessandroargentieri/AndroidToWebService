# AndroidToWebService
Android Studio app which connects to a PHP web service through GET and POST methods. This WS connects to a MySQL database on the same web server where the Web service is present. It's also important because it treats Json messages. In the MainActivity.java there is also the commented code of the PHP pages composing the Web Service.
